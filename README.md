# Human Activity Recognition Using Machine Learning
The goal of this project is to create a model that can anticipate human behaviours like walking, walking up or down stairs, sitting, standing, or lying down.The Dataset choosen from kaggle database.This dataset was gathered from 30 individuals who were wearing smartphones around their waists while engaging in a variety of activities. The accelerometer and gyroscope sensors of the smartphone are used to record the data.They have recorded "3-axial linear acceleration" (tAcc-XYZ) from the accelerometer and "3-axial angular velocity" (tGyro-XYZ) from the gyroscope using the sensors (gyroscope and accelerometer) in a smartphone with various modifications.In those measures, the prefix "t" stands for time.3-axial signals in the X, Y, and Z directions are represented by the suffix "XYZ."
# Algorithms used
The following machine learning algorithms were used for training and testing the models:
- Logistic Regression
- Random Forest
- K-Nearest Neighbors
- Support Vector Machine
- Naive Bayes
